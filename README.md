ðŸš€ Exciting News! ðŸŒŸ I'm thrilled to share my first-ever YouTube tutorial series on leveraging Langchain and large language models (LLMs) to create an application that enables conversational interaction with structured data.

ðŸŽ¥ Check out the complete series here: https://lnkd.in/dqqegUgT

In this series, I cover everything from setting up SQL query chains to integrating speech technology, demonstrating practical applications for data interaction and conversational AI.
I'll admit, it's my first time creating video tutorials, so bear with me! I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and exploring new technologies.
